Welcome to your new Jekyll site! This post demonstrates how content works in your new setup.

## What You've Got

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator that converts your markdown files into a beautiful website
- **Obsidian**: Perfect for writing and managing your markdown content with features like:
  - [[Wikilinks]] for easy cross-referencing
  - Graph view to see connections between your notes
  - Powerful search and organization
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatic deployment when you push changes

## Getting Started with Obsidian

1. Open Obsidian and create a new vault pointing to this directory
2. Start writing in markdown - every `.md` file becomes a page
3. Use `[[double brackets]]` to link between pages
4. Organize your content in folders as you see fit

## Publishing Content

Just push your changes to GitHub and your site will automatically rebuild and deploy!

### Next Steps

- Create an [[About]] page
- Add more posts to the `_posts` directory
- Customize the styling in `assets/css/main.css`
- Explore Jekyll's powerful features like collections and data files
