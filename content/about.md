### Creative engineering

Hi, I’m Jon, a creative engineer.

I started Human Crafted in 2016 as a boutique product design studio and solo design brand after having worked across agencies and corporate OEM’s for the previous 15 years. Setting sail as an entrepreneur and freelance designer wasn’t an easy decision, but taking the path less traveled has become a trend that I’ve learned to embrace.

Throughout this site you will find a diversified range of projects and products, each starting with an idea to **make something better** at its core. This pursuit of better has driven me to fine tune my craft for speed and efficiency, building a wide range of skills so I can adapt to a new need at any moment.

I am proud of this range, and I’ve come to appreciate it as my super power. 🦸🏻‍♂️
