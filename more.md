### Engineering my own path

Hi, I'm Jon, a creative engineer. I started Human Crafted in 2016 as a boutique product design studio and solo design brand after having worked across agencies and corporate OEM's for the previous 15 years. Setting sail as an entrepreneur and freelance designer wasn't an easy decision, but taking the path less traveled has become a trend that I've learned to embrace.

Throughout this site you will find a diversified range of projects and products, each starting with an idea to **make something better** at its core. This pursuit of better has driven me to fine tune my craft for speed and efficiency, developing [expertise](_docs/expertise.md) that span creative design and technical engineering so I can adapt to a new need at any moment. I coined the term "Creative Engineer" to describe this unique combination. I am proud of this range, and I've come to appreciate it as my super power. 🦸🏻‍♂️ 

On this site you can learn more about me, explore my [past work](index.md), dig into my [process](_docs/process.md), and reference the [tools](_docs/tools.md) that help me bring ideas to life.  Or if you want to talk further, get in touch [here](lab.md).

### Process

Build to learn. I cut through the chaos to identify the next discrete and logical step to solve any problem. Then I get to work rapidly building solutions to test, informing future steps, and above all... **MAKING PROGRESS.**

I'm a great match when these apply:

- Having trouble getting started...
- Your project is stuck and you need a boost...
- Big dreams, but limited budget...
- You want to fly under-the-radar among giants...
