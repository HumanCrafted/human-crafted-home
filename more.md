title: Engineering my own path.
permalink: /more/

Hi, I‚Äôm Jon, a creative engineer. I started Human Crafted in 2016 as a boutique product design studio and solo design brand after having worked across agencies and corporate OEM‚Äôs for the previous 15 years. Setting sail as an entrepreneur and freelance designer wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, but taking the path less traveled has become a trend that I‚Äôve learned to embrace.

Throughout this site you will find a diversified range of projects and products, each starting with an idea to **make something better** at its core. This pursuit of better has driven me to fine tune my craft for speed and efficiency, building a wide range of skills so I can adapt to a new need at any moment.  I coined the term "Creative Engineer" to fill a gap 

I am proud of this range, and I‚Äôve come to appreciate it as my super power. ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Process


![](public/images/vennColab.svg)

We build to learn. We cut through the chaos to identify the next discrete and logical step to solve any problem. Then we get to work rapidly building solutions to test, informing future steps, and above all... **MAKING PROGRESS.**

We are a great match when these apply:

- Having trouble getting started...
- Your project is stuck and you need a boost...
- Big dreams, but limited budget...
- You want to fly under-the-radar among giants...
